# Employee Tracker

## Description
This application allows command-line inputs to read information about employees from a back-end database using MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js

## Installation
Open the index.js file in an integrated terminal and run 'npm i' to install all the required packages. Next, navigate over towards the database file and run 'mysql -u root -p'. This will allow you to login to mysql. Then, run the SOURCE schema.sql and SOURCE seeds.sql. This will format and seed the required database. After, navigate back to your index.js file and run 'node index.js'. Pull data at will :)

To give users the ability to read data in JSON format from a sql database

## License
